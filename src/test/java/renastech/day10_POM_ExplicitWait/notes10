//to be able to do scroll down
   //you have 2 option
      //1.actions move to the element
    //need to create an object from actions
      Actions actions=new Actions(DriverUtil.getdriver());
      actions.moveToelement(iframe).perform();

      //2.JS Executer

    JavaScriptExecutor javascriptExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) DriverUtil.getDriver();
    //to make jsexecuter works you need to do casting between driver and jsexecuter

    BrowserUtils.wait(3);
    javascriptExecutor.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);" , iframe);

  Either for actions or jsexecuter first you need to create connection the place that they are going to work which is
   in action class created with constractor and it has webdriver so you can pass
      Actions actioms = new Actions (DriverUtil.getDriver());

      in jsexecuter since it has no constactor to make jsexecuter to understand where is going to be connect which is
      //you need to cast with driver
      JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor =(JavascriptExecutor)DriverUtil.getdriver();



/*The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the WebDriver to
wait for a certain amount of the time before it throws a "No Such element Exception".
The default setting is 0.Once we set the time, the webdirver will
wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception
*/

/*
    Explicit Wait
    The Explicit Wait in selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for
    certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceed before
    throwing "ElementNotVisibleException" exception.
    It is an intelligent kind of wait , but it can be applied only for specified elements.
    It gives better options than implicit wait as it waits for  dynamically loaded Ajax elements.
    */

WEBDRIVERWAIT CLASS (Explicit wait)

  -->We use explicit wait if we are waiting for some specific webElement or action to happen
  -This will wait up to given seconds like implicit wait.(if condition happens on the third second wait will wait
  (it wont wait whole time to get finish it will only wait until condition gets true)
  -After 20 it will throw TimeOutException if condition not happens

  Examples:
  alertIsPresent()
  elementSelectionStatesToBe()
  elementToBeClickable()
  elementToBeSelected()
  frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt()
  invisibilityOfTheElementLocated()
  invisibilityOfElementWithText()
  presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy()
  presenceOfElementLocated()
  textToBePresentInElement()
  textToBePresentInElementLocated()
  textToBePresentInElementValue()
  titleIs()
  titleContains()
  visibilityOf()
  visibilityOfAllElements()
  visibilityOfAllElementsLocatedBy()
  visibilityOfElementLocated()
