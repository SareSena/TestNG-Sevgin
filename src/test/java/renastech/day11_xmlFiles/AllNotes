TestNg.Xml file is a configuration file that helps in organizing our tests.
It allows testers to create and handle multiple test classes, define test suites and tests.

It makes a tester's job easier by controlling the execution of tests by putting all the test cases together
and run it under one XML file.This is a beautiful concept, without which, it is difficult to work in TestNG

//div[starts-with(@attribute, 'value')]
//div[ends-with(@attribute, 'value']
