ASSERTIONS:
-> Assertions are coming from TestNG
->Assertions allows us to do our verification for our test cases

->You can pass an additional argument into assertion methods just to provide additional information about what failed.
    //to be able to print on the console

--> assertEquals :
    -This method two arguments to be passed: actual ,expected
    -It compares these two values and if they are exact match ,it will pass.

-->assertTrue:
    -This method expects you to pass a boolean value.or you have to pass a method that returns a boolean value.
    -If the boolean value is True,it will pass.If not it will fail.

-->assertFalse:
    -This method expects you to pass a boolean value.
    -If the boolean value is False, it will pass.If not it will fail.

-->If your assertion fails, it will stop running for the current test in the same line where it failed.
It will move to the next test.And start running that one.

How to ignore a test?
1-Add @ignore on top of the test.

In what order the tests are running if we have multiple tests?
   ->By default tests are running in alphabetical order.(case sensitive capitals come first)

   priority=> You can change the running order using priority.
   -We can change priority which will change the running order of the tests

 How do we handle dropdowns using Selenium?
 HOW MANY TYPES OF DROPDOWN ARE THERE?

 1-Select dropdowns: are created by using  <select. tag in HTML

    <select>
      <option value ="1"> option1 </option>
      <option value ="2"> option2 </option>
      <option value ="3"> option3 </option>
    </select>

--use select class to locate them.
by value, index and text

2-HTML dropdowns: these are the dropdowns that are created NOT USING <select>
  -These dropdowns are handled just like any other webElement you will see on the page.
