 How do we handle web tables using Selenium Webdriver?

 --> We create specific xpath locators to locate what we want to get from the table itself.

 How do we handle web tables?
 -By creating custom locators to get whatever i need to get from the table.
 ->If i need to get the whole row, i create a locator that returns me the whole row.
 ->If i need to get 1 single cell, i need to create a locator that returns me 1 single cell.

 //table[@id='ct100_MainContent_orderGrid']/body/tr      they are the same thing
 //table[@id='ct100_MainContent_orderGrid']//tr

 ALERTS
 There are 2 types of alerts
 1-HTML Alerts:
   --> How do we handle: We just locate just as another web element on the page.
   -->Then we click
 2-JavaScript Alerts:

 HOW DO WE HANDLE ALERTS?
    --> Using Alerts
    -->JS alerts are not part of the HTML structure.Therefore we need to switch the driver focus to the that alert
    1-Create an instance of Alert, then switch to alert.
      Alert alert = driver.switchTo.alert();
    2-to accept, dismiss
      alert.accept();
      alert.dismiss();

 IFRAMES

 --> Iframes are basically <html> inside of another <html>
 --> Selenium can only focus one thing at a time
 so we need to SWITCH driver's focus to the inner iframe to be able to perform any action with selenium.

      1-Locating as Webelement then using that webelement to switch
      Webelement iframe = driver.findelement(LOCATOR);
      driver.switchTo.frame(iframe);

      2-Switching by index.We pass the index number of the frame.
      -->If you have more than one iframe on the page indexes are used.
      <iframe> --> index 0
      <iframe> --> index 1
      <iframe> --> index 2

      driver.switchTo.frame(0);

      3-Switching by id or name attribute value.
      driver.switchTo.frame("idValue");
      driver.switchTo.frame("nameValue");
