/*
    Explicit Wait
    The Explicit Wait in selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for
    certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceed before
    throwing "ElementNotVisibleException" exception.
    It is an intelligent kind of wait , but it can be applied only for specified elements.
    It gives better options than implicit wait as it waits for  dynamically loaded Ajax elements.
