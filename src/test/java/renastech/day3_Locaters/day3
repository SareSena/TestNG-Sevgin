//   driver.findElement(By.className("gLFyf gsfi")).sendKeys("Apple");
          //if classname has space in it it is not good idea to use most of the case you will receive an error.
          driver.findElement(By.className("gLFyf")).sendKeys("Apple");
          //you can remove after space and try to locate if class name is unique
    //if webElement also has classname attribute but it is not unique so it is not good idea to use.
   //if id is dynamic means (when you refresh page and if you see id is changing that means is dynamic) it wont be useful.

6-tagName
--you locate using tagname itself
--the usage of this one not too much
--it is good if you want print same tagnames

for ex  : if you wanna print all links in the page then you will use this method
driver.findElements(By.tagName(a))
driver.findElements(By.tagName(div))

getText()
--this one will be getting the text of given webelement
--it is returning you the text of element as a String

<a id="ert" href="www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>
getText method will return you Amazon

getAttribute ("attribute name")   //gives us value of attribute
<a id="ert" href="www.amazon.com"
>Amazon</a>
getAttribute("id")
this one will print you ert


Utilities Package
The reason of using utilities
1-to make our code more reusable
2-easy to maintanence
(in the future if you wanna change something instead of going each class
you will only change from utilities
3-Reduce typing of same codes over and over


7- cssSelector
it has own syntax
common methods that you can use for css

1.tagname[attribute='value']
2.tagname.value-->. means in css locator className
3.tagname#value #means id in css

--you can also go from parent to child
div[class='er4g'] > a


8- xpath
2 type xpath : Absulate and Relative

      1-Absolute Xpath
      -start with /
      -you need to start top to parent (beginning of HTML code)
      -it is not useful because it takes from very top to child

      html
         head
         body
            div
            div
                div
                   a
                div
            div
            div
         body
         head
      html


     for ex: /html/body/div/div/a
            /html/body/div
     if you have siblings you can use [number].it will pick the siblings for you
            /html/body/div[2]



      2-relative xpath
 --starts with //
 --double // allows you to locate your webElement from anywhere in html code
 --more useful when compare for absolute xpath because you can start anywhere in html code

 some syntax of using relative xpath
 1-//tagname[@attribute='value']--looks for tagname attribute and value
 2-//tagname[contains(@attribute,'value')] -- locate webElement with the given value if contains
 dynamic id usually has static part and dynamic part
 ex:
 id = hello123
 refresh page
 id = hello578
 refresh page
 id=hello23423
 //tagname[contains(@id='hello')

 3-//tagname[.='text'] --looks for exact text match for any attribute

ex:
             <div class="est">
                  <a class "def" href="www.google.com">
              div
//a[@class='def']
                tagname div
                attribute class
                attribute value est
